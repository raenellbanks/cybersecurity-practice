**Breakdown:**
- **Timestamp**: 2025-06-22 at 2:31 AM
- **ID**: Possibly a process or request ID
- **Service**: `scimUsers` — likely a microservice or identity component
- **Action**: `GET` — HTTP method to retrieve information
- **Target Endpoint**: `/identity/provisioning/v1/scim/v2/Users` — fetching user list via SCIM API

**Potential Concern:**
- Could be normal user provisioning...
- But repeated or automated GETs to this endpoint could indicate **user enumeration**.

**Next Steps (if this were real):**
- Check source IP of request
- Look at the frequency of access
- Monitor for failed POST attempts or other odd behavior
