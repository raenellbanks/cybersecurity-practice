# Splunk Log Analysis Practice

This folder contains practice files, queries, and notes from my hands-on work with Splunk Enterprise.

### What Iâ€™m Practicing:
- Ingesting log files
- Writing SPL (Search Processing Language) queries
- Detecting brute force attempts
- Building dashboards
- Creating alerts

All drills are part of my cybersecurity learning journey with Merit America and my personal lab setup.
