Log Analysis: Strange Login Activity
-------------------------------------

Date: June 22

Summary of Events:
- Multiple failed login attempts occurred between 08:13:45 and 08:14:10.
- All failed attempts targeted invalid users: admin, root, test, guest, oracle, webmaster.
- The attempts originated from a single IP address: 192.168.1.24.
- This pattern suggests a brute force attack targeting default or privileged usernames.

Legitimate Activity:
- One successful login occurred for user 'raenell' from IP 10.0.0.16 at 08:14:02.
- That session was later closed properly, indicating normal usage.

Conclusion:
- Suspicious activity identified from IP 192.168.1.24.
- Recommend investigating the source and blocking the IP if not authorized.
- No signs of compromise from the valid login.
